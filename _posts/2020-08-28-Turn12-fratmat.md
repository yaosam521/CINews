**Yamoussoukro** - A troubling legacy in Côte d'Ivoire that has plagued the nation since independence is the problem of stateless individuals and determining citizenship.

What is a stateless person? Under the UN, stateless individuals are those "**who are not considered citizens or nationals under the operation of the laws of any country**". 

How prevalent is this issue in Côte d'Ivoire? It is estimated that there are around 700,000 people who are stateless, many of whom are abandoned children. Because of citizenship laws, stateless people are unable to attend high school, let alone college, unable to hold regular jobs, create bank accounts, travel around the country freely, among other things official citizens enjoy. 

How did we get into this position? Asides from the problem of abandoned children and orphans, during the colonial era, the French brought thousands of people from Mali, Senegal, and Burkina Faso to work on plantations in Côte d'Ivoire. After the nation gained independence in 1960, many of these people were not granted citizenship, and as a result their descendents remain stateless, without official papers or documents.

Another source of statelesness is refugees fleeing violence. Often, refugees come into Côte d'Ivoire seeking refuge from the violence that has plagued West Africa in the past. Many come without documents, and are unable to go back to their home countries due to the situation, therefore they are stuck in a country without official papers.

Statelessness, in addition to being a beaureaucratic and human rights nightmare, is one of the main reasons for low educational attainment and getting people stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty. It would be beneficial for everyone if we could register stateless people in Côte d'Ivoire and put them on a path to citizenship.

How could we tackle this problem? I propose a plan I call the **A**nti-**S**tatelessnes**s** and **C**itizenship **R**etention Tr**ack**. The steps in this plan would be as follows:

1. The creation of a national database of citizens. Include an attribute that includes a handprint and possibly a retinal scan or DNA identification.
2. Sign birthright citizenship into law. Those who are born in hospitals will immediately be registered as Ivorian citizens. 
3. Anyone currently living in Côte d'Ivoire who cannot provide documentation as to their country of origin will be provided the opportunity to apply for citizenship. For those who are under the age of 18, you will be provided with a temporary document that grants a student visa under the condition that you complete middle or high school. After the completion of school, you will be granted citizenship. If you are over the age of 18, you can gain your citizenship through military service totaling 5 years, apply for a student visa and gain your citizenship through the completion of university or any higher educational attainment, provide proof of work for the last 10 years, or find a job through the government jobs board and work for 7 years, after which you will be granted citizenship. It is illegal for the employers on the jobs board to discriminate against hiring someone based on statelessness or refugee status, and furthermore it is illegal to pay members of these two camps lesser wages.

Through these three steps, I am confident that Côte d'Ivoire can begin to provide the opportunity for upward growth, and I hope the ASSCRACK program will be a beacon of hope to those stuck in the cycle of poverty.
