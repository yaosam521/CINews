<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> - Chieck Cissé and Ruth Gbagbi are no strangers to the spotlight when it comes to the athletic realm. However, both are taking a leap into the limelight once more when Ramon Film Productions announced that the Taekwondo power duo would be starring in the new West African Martial Arts Comedy titled <em>Everybody Hates Chad</em>.</p>

<p><em>Everybody Hates Chad</em> follows the antics of two well-meaning but clumsy Ivorian diplomats, played by Cissé and Gbagbi, who are in charge of the mail coming in and out of the Ivorian Embassy in Chad. One day during a mail-sorting mishap, they accidentally send the Ambassador’s gift to his mistress, a sex toy, to The Grand Poobah of Chad™, Culmerde. After they realize what they have done, the two diplomats set out to retrieve the package before it gets in the hands of Culmerde, who is unstable and has caused much suffering on regular Chadians to feed his fragile ego. But it turns out that The Grand Poobah Culmerde is not their only enemy. The Chadian mafia also wants to get their hands on the package so they can brainwash Culmerde and run the country from the shadows! And behold, an international coalition run by snooty Frenchman Jean-Claude LaBussy wants in on the package to keep Culmerde in their pocket? The clock has begun to tick for the Ivorian diplomats to correct their error or it could be nuclear war!</p>

<p>Gbagbi and Cissé, who have also starred in multiple actions dramas such as The Abidjan Job and Assassination Dreams, described how they wanted to move away from the action genre and determine their own paths in their acting careers. Comedy sounded like a nice change.</p>

<p>“I think it’s a welcome change, since action dramas required a lot of training, not to mention the amount of safety work that needs to be put in place to ensure that everyone stays healthy”, says Gbagbi, whom we met on the set. “Not to mention that in Assassination Dreams, it followed the real story of the infamous Yamoussoukro Ripper. A lot of the production staff had to go to therapy afterwards because of how horrific the crimes were. So comedy is very much a welcome change.”</p>

<p>Some critics say that this film is yet another futile attempt at Anti-Chadian propaganda, whom have shared a rocky relationship with Cote d’Ivoire in the past few years due to a diplomatic incident being blown way out of proportion. Yet the vast majority of Ivorians say that while they’ve put the incident behind them, Chad is still a pariah in the African community and an all-around nuisance to law-abiding countries.</p>

<p>The film is scheduled to be released this fall.</p>
