**Lacs District** - After the death of beloved former Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly, widely considered to be Ouattara’s pick as successor, Jeannot Ahoussou-Kouadio, the former Prime Minister, entered the presidential race to take President Alassane Ouattara’s place as the RHDP party representative. 

In a statement released on Friday, Ahoussou-Kouadio announced his bid for the presidency, releasing his platform on his campaign website. His platform emphasizes the “continuation of strong relations with France, raising the standard of living for Ivorians, and solidifying the identity of this young republic."

Ouattara, who has been in power for 20 years, says that while he wishes to see the Ivory Coast grow under his vision, if the country is to retain the democratic vision of the founding father, Felix Houphouet-Boigny, he must hand power to whomever wins the general election if it is legitimate and fair. 

West African countries have historically had trouble with transitions to power, and the Ivory Coast is no stranger to this problem. In 2010, the country descended into civil war after former president Laurent Gbagbo refused to concede a verified election to Alassane Ouattara. After several years of instability and fighting, Gbagbo was captured and convicted by the ICC of election fraud. 

The Gbagbo fiasco highlights a problem that has plagued the Ivory Coast since its independence from France. The executive branch retains a strong amount of power over the country, and since the RHDP has held a majority in the country, this has led to accusations of a one-party state. 

The Ivorian Popular Front, a center-left party, has accused the RHDP, the majority party which is center-right, of rigging elections in their favor and have boycotted elections in the past. As a result of Gbagbo’s electoral interference and refusal to give up the executive, the IPF party was kicked out of Socialists International in 2011 and have not been allowed back since. 

Various political experts have suggested diverting power from the executive branch and dividing it among the Supreme Court, the National Assembly, and the Legislative branch, similar to how the United States conducts government through its “Separation of Powers” into the White House, Capitol Hill, and the Supreme Court. Critics of this suggestion have used American government deadlock and the parliamentary paralysis of the Fourth French Republic that led to a crisis in Algeria to advocate that the executive branch should remain powerful and that the system is fine as it is.
