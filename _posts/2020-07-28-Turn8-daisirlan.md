**Abidjan** -  Right Wing lawmakers around the world are demanding that Nestlé hire liberals into their Anti-Union death squads because they claim that using the term "Right-wing death squads" is politically incorrect and makes them look bad.

A recent manifesto, signed by many right-wing lawmakers around the world, including American Senator Lindsey Graham, lamented that using the term "right-wing death squad" makes the political right look bad and that they, among other things, should not only open their ranks to include more liberals, but also change their name to "left-wing death squad", since they argue that only liberals and marxists can engage in violence and that the mere ideology of the political right is antithetical to violence. 

"We, the right of the world, are tired of constantly being portrayed as the bad guy by liberals. As such, we have created this manifesto to demand that all sides of the political spectrum, especially liberals, be hired when being considered for jobs that harass and murder laborers who demand to not be exploited (1)", reads the preamble of the 945 page manifesto, a copy of which was obtained by *Le Daisirlan* online via *4chan*. Most of the pages regurgitate the same phrases without meaning over and over again, such as proposition 476, which demands that "Neo-Cultural Marxits(sic)" be forced to join the aforementioned strikebreaking anti-labor units. 

As to the political incorrectness of such a term as "right-wing death squad", conservatives say it hurts their reputation because the Republicans, a conservative political party in the USA, should be known solely for being the party of Abraham Lincoln, the president who abolished slavery, while overlooking the funding of anti-labor paramilitary groups in Central and South America to continue to steal fruit and various other resources. As the manifesto states, "It's not fair that we get associated with anti-labor killers and oppressing laborers to line our pockets. The real blame should go to the liberals, who think that it's feasible to give rights to workers and expect us businessowners to not suffer. I mean WE, the plantation owners, landlords, and megacorporation CEOs are workers too! We deserve to have the right to widen our profit margins by the fullest!"
