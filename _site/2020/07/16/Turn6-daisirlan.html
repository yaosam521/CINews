<hr />

<p><strong>Paris</strong> -  French President Emmanuel Macron was seen holding Alassane Ouattara’s hand as they crossed the street to enter the Palais Bourbon after grabbing breakfast at Le Cafe du Weenie Hut.</p>

<p>“Remember to look both ways when crossing the street, sonny.” Macron said to Ouattara. “Ok Daddy”, he sheepishly responded, more interested in sipping his hot cocoa.</p>

<p>Macron and Ouattara walked into the chamber of the National Assembly, where Macron went to present a bill after placing Ouattara in his booster seat with an iPad so he wouldn’t disrupt the session. As Macron introduced the bill, his secretaries and interns rushed to Ouattara’s side to make sure that he would have just enouch Petit Écolier cookies and milk to last through the presentation.</p>

<p>When lunchtime came around and the presentation was finished, Macron picked up Ouattara as the janitors came to clean the chamber floor of cookie crumbs, snot, and crayon drawings of flying cars. They were spotted in the National Assembly Canteen, where Macron tried to hide get Ouattara to eat his legumes by hiding them in a spoonful of Steak Tartare. Of course, Ouattara was more interested in the fries and chicken fingers, much to Macron’s exasperation.</p>

<p>As the evening drew to a close and the chamber was dismissed, Macron and Ouattara headed home to the Élysée Palace, where Ouattara finished his math homework. At 9 pm, it was time for Ouattara’s bedtime, and as he was tucked into bed, Macron whispered, “Remember, if you need any help, Papa Macron will always be there to help, you just have to ask, okay? I will always be there as an influence in your life as long as I live.”</p>
