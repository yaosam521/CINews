**Yamoussoukro** - Earlier last year saw the completion of the so-called National Chocolate Company, a valiant success by the Ivorian government to reverse the historic exploitation of Côte d’Ivoire’s rich cocoa resources. This was inspired by Namibia’s somewhat successful wrangling of diamond production so that they could reap greater profits out of the diamond trade for their own country’s sake. Nobody can doubt the success of the NCC. NCC Candy bars now line the grocery store shelves, getting picked up by sweet-tooths and children, much to their delight. NCC Chocolate Drinks are now a staple among young Ivorian children during lunch time. And NCC chocolate delights are being praised by chocolate critics and connoisseurs worldwide, in awe of the wide selection of chocolates from white chocolate to milk chocolate, to 90% cacao and to even ruby chocolate. 

This isn’t even to mention the effect that the NCC has had on our economy. Child labor has gone down a whopping 80% on cocoa farms all across Côte d’Ivoire, and many are in the process of transitioning back to school life. Wages are higher than ever for laborers, and many have begun opening bank accounts to deposit their savings, something unheard of even two years ago, as bank access was very rare for the common laborer.
All this comes down to the age-old question: How much attention the government is able to give to the industry, leading us to the crossroads of how far is too far when it comes to government involvement? 

A poll from 2024 shows that Ivorians fall everywhere on the political spectrum on socialism. Regarding the NCC, at first only 45% of Ivorians approved of it, while 42% disapproved and 13% had no opinion. However, the approval rating shot up to 82% within two years after the NCC unveiled the hit Chocolate Drink with Cinnamon, and only 7% disapproved. 

The same poll reveals that the majority of Ivorians support government oversight and control of transportation infrastructure, universal healthcare, and a countrywide postal service. The polls become more contested when asked to rank government control of the means of production. However, there is a slightly more positive outlook towards collective (meaning community owned as opposed to Parliamentary ownership) administration, perhaps coinciding with the formation of worker’s unions in the NCC to bargain benefits and wages.

It is unclear if the uptick in interest in socialism follows the recent announcement that multiple PM’s, influenced by Burkinabé revolutionary Thomas Sankara, began to advocate for the removal of foreign influence. 

However, what is clear is that the debate as to which degree of control the government should have over the social programs of everyday Ivorians will not stop anytime soon.
