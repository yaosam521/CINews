<p><strong>Montagnes District</strong> - The Ministry of Economics rolled out checks to underpaid farmers in an effort to curb the growing need for farmland to produce cash crops.</p>

<p>Farmers in Cote d’Ivoire, noted as some of the most impoverished in the world, recieved raises of upwards to 5,000 Eco to compensate the financial losses expected to be incurred from halting the growth of their farms.</p>

<p>This was one of the short-term plans conjured up by research teams in the Ministry of Economics, who note that as long as the price of the crops remained low, the lives of these farmers would always be one of perpetual poverty. Even if this would provide mometary relief for the farmers, there are plans to take the compensation of farmers further.</p>

<p>Noting that the country seems to lack an industrial base to process agriculture asides from the nationalization of the chocolate industry years ago, the Ministry of Economics has laid out plans to that ensure that demand will not completely overrun and destroy the ecosystem of Cote d’Ivoire.</p>

<p>The matter is simply just supply vs demand. Since demand is very high for agriculture, farmers have been clearing more rainforest in order to create arable land for our crops, making more money in the process. But if farmers are paid well enough to no longer have a need to clear the rainforest, then eventually we could see a halt in deforestation and hopefully a reversal in the trend. Naturally, this will cause a drop in supply, which will raise prices, then the government will no longer have to subsidize the farming industry to ensure that farmers aren’t starving and can’t feed themselves.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is a relatively simple plan for a complex international economy, but economic experts in the ministry are optimistic that this can make a dent in the rampant destruction of the environment.</p>
