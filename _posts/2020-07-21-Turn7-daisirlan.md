**Abidjan** -  As the WestAR is nearing completion, members of Le Daisirlan were invited to the WestAR development office in Abidjan to have a sneak peak at what entertainment will be available to those who have the money to pay for a luxury trip, and if you're a fan of *Thomas the Tank Engine* bootlegs with our president's face on the trains, you're in for a treat.

Since the financial planning for WestAR gave very little consideration for onboard entertainment for the passengers, the only movies available were *A Cure for Insomnia*, *Who Killed Captain Alex?*, *Chitty Chitty Bang Bang*, and *The Bye Bye Man*, as these were the only movies that were willing to be hosted on the trains as of this year. Riders can also view fine TV Shows such as *Joey*, the sequel to *Friends*, and they can also listen to Megalovania on repeat for the entire duration of the ride.
