<hr />

<p><strong>Leeds, England</strong> - After announcing on Twitter that Blur will not put into consideration recording Song 3, the long-awaited sequel to their hit 90’s britpop song “Song 2”, angry fans overran Twitter headquarters in San Francisco to manually cancel Blur’s Twitter account.</p>

<p>The band, who says they are tired of endlessly shouting “WOOHOO” until time immemorial, announced back in mid 2024 that after careful consideration, they would halt all progress on the recording of Song 3, which caused stocks worldwide to drop to an all-time low. The NASDAQ and S&amp;P500 recorded their lowest records ever, while the stock markets in Asia, Africa, and Europe reported that computers were catching on fire because they could not process how low stock values had gone.</p>

<p>Shortly after the announcement, riots began popping up in the UK and Ireland, with angry people (not all of them Blur fans, which is interesting) torching cars, trashing schools, and destroying any form of civilisation that they could find within a 10-km radius. Video on Twitter shows the Empire State Building in New York City collapsing after rioters blew up the base of the building.</p>

<p>Even the riot police joined in on the violence, using the chaos to drive their police cruisers straight into kindergartens and to post pictures of their genitalia on the Times Square advert signs.</p>

<p>In Florida, massive gangs of Floridamen strapped IED’s to crocodiles, who were let loose in the streets. And in another related incident, Brazilians were posting on Instagram that they no longer wanted Blur to come to Brazil.</p>

<p>Damon Albarn, the frontman of blur, was unable to be reached for contact, although there are rumours that he and the rest of Blur are currently hiding in a bunker in Scotland.</p>
