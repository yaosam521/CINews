<hr />

<p><strong>Yamoussoukro</strong> - A couple of years ago, President Ouattara and the Defense Ministry decided to halt aid relations with the United States because of derogatory comments Donald Trump had made, including calling Ouattara the worst anti-Ivorian slur, “sakjdlnasdfinalsknnasdikn”. While our political and economic capabilities were not significantly set back, the same could not be said for the Ivorian military. This wouldn’t normally be a huge deal, but three major incidents have led us to question the lack of attention that the military gets from the government.</p>

<h2 id="1-the-ethiopian-false-flag-operation">1. The Ethiopian False-Flag Operation</h2>

<p>Ethiopia was able to successfully infiltrate Somalia and stage a massacre to influence the world’s opinion on the secession of Somaliland. Granted, the military capabilities of Somalia are very strained given the decades of civil conflict and warfare that have plagued the Horn of Africa, however, this should not be used as an excuse to stay complacent with our military’s strength. We have suffered two civil wars in the past twenty years, greatly hindering our rebuilding of the military. Should another civil war be on the horizon, Cote d’Ivoire would be a prime target for other nations to take advantage of our resources. As the world’s leading producer of Cacao, there very well could be bad actors out there in the world waiting for the right moment to strike to regain cheaper access to chocolate and regain their economic dominance over Cote d’Ivoire. This would set back all of the progress that we have gained in the past four years and rebuilding would require nothing short of a Herculean effort to regain what we would lose. As such, keeping our military up-to-date with resumed arms trade with the United States would reduce the risk of such an infiltration happening in our country.</p>

<h2 id="2-the-chadian-embassy-incident">2. The Chadian Embassy Incident</h2>

<p>When Chad was caught not once, but twice trying to infiltrate Libya, Chadian President Idriss Deby had a hard year being isolated due to international condemnation of his actions. The Ivorian ambassador to Chad decided to send him a tasteless gift of an anime body pillow and some masturbation materials along with chocolate, presumably as a joke. His joke ended up riling security at the embassy and in the ensuing chaos, N’Djamenna PD beat the mail courier to death, and eyewitnesses say that a rabbit was also beat within an inch of its life. While the ambassador was rebuked by President Ouattara, Deby demanded that Cote d’Ivoire apologize for the incident, even going as far as to beg the Assembly of the African Union to condemn Cote d’Ivoire for the actions of its security guards while calling it “terrorism”. Chad has threatened action against us, and as they have embraced their reputation as a rogue state, there is no way to accurately predict what actions the rogue government will attempt. Will they attempt to send spies our way? If they do, what kind of discord would they solve? Either way, Chad has shown that they prefer the art of espionage to diplomacy. Investing in military intelligence would prevent such a scenario.</p>

<p>And who better to ask for intelligence defense technology than America? Ever since the War on Terror, America has quietly spent years building their defensive infrastructure to spy on their citizens via the NSA and detect anomalies in their international travel to detect terror cells moving across the world. We could ask the United States to provide us with equipment that will allow us to keep tabs on persons of interest that have ties to rogue nations such as Chad, again reducing the likelihood in the future that bad agents will incite violence or terror attacks on our country.</p>

<h2 id="3-cote-divoires-presence-in-continentalinternational-affairs">3. Cote d’Ivoire’s Presence in Continental/International Affairs</h2>

<p>For some time, Cote d’Ivoire has remained relatively isolationist in reaction to world events, and the complete surprise that overtook the administration when they were elected for a seat on the Peace and Security Council reflects this. In contrast, this shows that many in Africa see Cote d’Ivoire as an up-and-coming nation that can throw its weight around. There are several conflicts that could use PSC Mediation in Africa, notably the Somalian Peacekeeping Operation, the Libyan Civil War, and conflict in the Central African Republic. Should war break out and the PSC is called to do a mission, we should be able to aid our fellow PSC members and lend a peacekeeping force that at least matches if not exceeds the level of the other troops. As many countries on the PSC have militaries that exceed our technological capabilities, we shouldn’t let them do all the grunt work, but heed Africa’s call for defense should the need arise. America is exceedingly generous in arms deals compared to our friends in France and Great Britain, and would be of enormous help to fulfill such a large order.</p>

<p>It is understandable that the President cancelled arms trade with the United States after the deplorable comments Trump made about West Africa. While Trump’s words and condescension of us shouldn’t be excused, the best answer to these jeers would be to rise to the occasion and exceed the expectations of those who think the least of you. And it’s made even better when they are willing to help you at it, isn’t it?</p>
