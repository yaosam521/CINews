<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> -  Executives and Officials have announced that WestAR is nearing completion, and economic advisors to President Alassane Ouattara are discussing multiple possible projects to follow up with WestAR.</p>

<p>“We are pleased to announce that the WestAR project is nearing completion” said Hamed Kouadio, the head engineer of the Ivoirian project division, during a recent press briefing. “We are looking forward to having a tighter connection not just between the domestic population, but also between our immediate neighbors.”</p>

<p>The WestAR is expected to bring more travel throughout the West African region, particularly between Ghana, Côte d’Ivoire, and Liberia, who have spearheaded the first phase of the project, while the next phase of the project is expected to connect Mali and Nigeria with the first phase. WestAR is expected to bring more economic prosperity to the region as well. While the impending completion of WestAR is worth celebrating, there is talk of more plans of economic expansion among the Ouattara Administration.</p>

<p>Members of Ouattara’s Economic Advisory Committee have listed several plans that Ouattara has approved, but have not been finalized yet. Some of these projects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expanding the Autonomous Port of Abidjan</li>
  <li>Developing the chocolate manufacturing industry</li>
  <li>Sustainable farming practices</li>
  <li>Strengthening Fair Trade rules and hiring practices</li>
  <li>Upgrading internet services</li>
  <li>Transition from natural gas to renewable resources</li>
</ul>

<p>It is expected to take a long time before all of these projects are able to come into fruition, however all of these will contribute heavily to the economic and energy independence of the nation.</p>
