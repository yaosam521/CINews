<hr />

<p><strong>Yamoussoukro</strong> -  It’s widely understood that during the colonial years, Europe sought to build up their wealth while leaving the common folk of Cote d’Ivoire and the rest of Africa dirt poor, leaving us to fend for ourselves in the wreckage of economic hardship and civil turmoil. While this is certainly a step backwards from our realization of a fully economically independent country, what isn’t talked about as often is how colonial economics is still implemented today, where Africa’s resources are extracted at a cheap cost, only to be processed down the road in countires like the UK, France, or America to be sold at a higher price.</p>

<p>This leaves Africa in a dire economic situation. It causes African wealth to lag behind the rest of the world, which in turn leads to brain drain, the exploitation of laborers, and a perpetual cycle of poverty. How can we ever hope to stop this?</p>

<p>For farming, the answer lies in taking back control of the production and processing of cocoa and cocoa products. The Netherlands, which is the world’s largest importer of cocoa beans, is able to process these beans into a product that can sell for a significantly larger sum of money down the stream. If we are able to invest in the machinery to process cocoa, we can carve a larger chunk of the cocoa trade profits for ourselves. In turn, we can fully compensate farmers, decrease the amount of cocoa beans we export, and finally get our child farmers to school.</p>

<p>This strategy has worked elsewhere. In Namibia, diamond companies used to export raw diamonds to the diamond trading company De Beers in London. But only when Namibia began to send the diamonds to Botswana for further processing did they begin to move away from the extractive economic model and produce their own product.</p>

<p>The economic advisors to President Ouattara have brought up investing in cocoa processing machinery so that we can create chocolate products locally and export them where there is demand. The luxury good is quite popular among all income brackets, and if we can come up with a local product that takes the world by storm, that would bring in a lot of wealth for our region. It’s been noted among Europeans and Australians that American chocolate “tastes like vomit” because of the chemicals they use when creating chocolate, so I wouldn’t image it would be too difficult of a hurdle to come up wtih a chocolate that tastes better than vomit at a reasonable price, which knocks out a surprisingly significant amount of competition. It would also be worth looking into expanding the culture of chocolate products in Côte d’Ivoire, creating a local company with worldwide prestige such as the likes of chocolate companies in Belgium or The Netherlands. It all ties down to how well we can engineer cocoa manufacturing and processing.</p>

<p>Investing in the manufacturing and industrialization of cocoa products would mean a future with sustainable cocoa harvesting, better distribution of wealth among our citizens, and an overall higher GDP and better economic well-being for the nation of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
