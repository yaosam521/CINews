<hr />

<p><strong>Los Angeles</strong> -  Infinity Ward, after taking a break from the Modern Warfare series in 2019 to focus on remastering Call of Duty: Ghosts, has announced that they will reboot Modern Warfare this year and the storyline of the campaign will take place in Africa, from the deserts of Chad to the urban cosmopolitan of Tanzania that is Maputo.</p>

<p>Chad Phillips, the lead storywriter of Infinity Ward’s writing team, gave some details about the campaign at the E3 2028 Conference. “All of our favorite characters from the Modern Warfare Series are coming back. Captain Price, the SAS crew, and Task Force 141 will see action in the urban streets of Mozambique, fight vicious combat in the deserts of Chad, and conduct stealth operations in the mountains of Tibet. I bring to you, Modern Warfaer 2028!”</p>

<p>The mission chosen to showcase Modern Warfare 2028 at E3 this year was a mission titled “Under the Radar”. At the beginning, Captain Price, Sergeant Kyle ‘Gaz’ Garrick, Task Force 141 members from Australia, Ireland, America, and Canada, and the playable character, French GIGN private Pascal ‘Salade’ Delon, are flying in a C-17 from Italy to conduct an illegal assault on an Al-Qaeda base in Chad. A rocket blows up the engines, forcing the entire team to jump out of the plane and land 10 clicks south of of the Al-Qaeda base. After thirty minutes of walking, the team finally neutralizes the entire base in a fast-paced shootout that leaves hundreds of Al-Qaeda insurgents dead. While searching the base, they find the President of Chad murdered in a compromising position, having been shot twice in the face and three times in the penis. Unfortunately, Al-Qaeda films the British Captain near the body of the president, and England is implicated in the assassination. After evading Egyptian forces who were sent to investigate the area, they eventually find their way to a car dealership where they escape across the border to Libya. As the UK was barred from entering the War of Chadian Agression, England has been implicated in a war crime committed under the Queen’s name.</p>

<p>Modern Warfare 2028 is expected to be released in 2029, although the recent behavior of Infinity Ward and Activision suggests that this game will be delayed several times.</p>
