<hr />

<p><strong>New York, New York</strong> - Matt Bellamy, the lead singer and lead guitar of the English Alternative Rock Band Muse, won twelve Grammy Awards this week for his wildly successful single, “Muscle Baby of Delusion”.</p>

<p>Bellamy accepted the award from this year’s presenter, Ghanaian pop icon Mustafa Suleiman, with help from his bandmates Dom Howard and Chris Wolstenholme as Bellamy exhibited confusion about his whereabouts, perhaps exhibited further by his strange choice of dress of nothing but red clown shoes.</p>

<p>The single made the Afrobeats Top 20 singles chart and have continued to take the number one spot on the UK and US Singles charts ever since the release, despite heavy protests by practitioners of the targeted political ideology.</p>

<p>As soon as drummer Dom Howard teased the lyrics of the single on his Instagram, followers of Esoteric Anarcha-Thatcherism began flooding the comments with ad-hominems and death threats, with some threatening to “honk when Muse is dead”.</p>

<p>Nontheless, “Muscle Baby of Delusion” proves to be a popularity juggernaut, already receiving 50 million plays on Spotify and the music video receiving close to 1 billion views and a like to dislike ratio of 140,000 likes to 78 dislikes.</p>

<p>Rumours have suggested that Muse recorded the single during a 5-day drug and alcohol binge.</p>
