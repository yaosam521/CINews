<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> - Students at Saint-Jérôme Secondary School in Abidjan’s Yopougon neighborhood are realizing the potential they have in getting their fellow peers involved in politics by using memes on Twitter to educate and entertain their audience.</p>

<p>Khaled Koumassi, a third-year student, was excited to learn about Côte d’Ivoire’s political atmosphere and history, but noticed many of his classmates in different classes seemed indifferent to the current climate. Feeling that it was more important for his generation to get into politics, he enlisted the help of his sister, second-year Fatima Koumassi, to get a twitter account off the ground.</p>

<p>“I saw that many of my classmates were unaware and ambivalent to the current political climate. There’s just so much that I want to learn about and it feels frustrating that almost none of my peers know what I’m talking about, so I decided to start posting memes on twitter to see if I could get them interested. And it worked!”.</p>

<p>The account, La Science Po à Saint-Jérôme (@ScienceJerome), has taken the school by storm, gaining 500 followers the first week it was open and has recieved numerous likes and retweets. His peers are showing signs of interest in political matters, as petitions to take and open more political science classes at Saint-Jérôme have risen nearly seventy-five percent for the next semester.</p>

<p>After graduation, Khaled plans to enroll at UFHB in Cocody and study law.</p>
