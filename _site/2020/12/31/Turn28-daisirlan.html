<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> - Last month, President Ouattara issued a stark warning about the novel HIV mutation known as HIV-Mutated, or HIV-M for short. Since then, it has been detected in at least 103 countries, including Côte d’Ivoire, Nigeria, South Africa, Egypt, the US, and China. A cure effort spearheaded by Mali has brought together multiple countries in Africa to devote resources to find a cure. Ouattara doubled down on his response, knowing that HIV is severe enough on its own, and has drafted every single resource Parliament could muster to combat the virus. But what have other countries been doing?</p>

<h3 id="anti-protection-protests-in-the-united-states-uk-devolve-into-sex-party-riots"><strong>Anti-Protection Protests in the United States, UK Devolve Into Sex Party Riots</strong></h3>
<p>Angered by CDC warnings to wear condoms during penetrative sex, thousands of Americans held rallies in the streets of New York, Los Angeles, and other large cities to protest against the new regulations. Many carried signs like “My PP My Choice” and “It’s NOT Your Business Where I Stick It!” and in Chicago there was a large bonfire where protesters bought all the condoms they could find within a 5-mile radius and burned them. Local News from Seattle reports that anti-protection protesters have barricaded themselves in the Capitol Hill neighborhood and has begun to hold a continuous, lawless orgy where those who choose to wear condoms out of concern for others are beaten and cast out of the “Autonomous Republican State of Capitol Hill” (ARSCH for short), more often than not without their clothing.</p>

<p>In Sheffield, England, constables tried to break up an anti-protection demonstration but were met with a barrage of leather whips and chains after the protest was hijacked by the local underground BDSM club. Local authorities say at least 83 constables were injured trying to contain the protest.</p>

<h3 id="china-issues-mandatory-chastity-belts-for-entire-population"><strong>China Issues Mandatory Chastity Belts for Entire Population</strong></h3>
<p>The CPC announced earlier this month that in order to combat HIV-M cases, they will be issuing chastity belts to the entire population above the age of 9. These belts are designed so that human waste is stored inside containers lining the belt, which can be emptied at various stations located across China.</p>

<p>Another feature that was implemented was the fitting of a device similar to an explosive collar, but the explosive device will detonate in the crotch area and render the genitalia of the wearer useless if the belt detects any attempt at tampering.</p>

<h3 id="singapore-legalizes-porn-estimates-say-9937-of-population-addicted"><strong>Singapore Legalizes Porn, Estimates Say 99.37% of Population Addicted</strong></h3>
<p>Singapore has taken a historic step in order to combat the HIV-M virus, as Parliament passed a law this week that uncensored various porn websites on the internet.</p>

<p>Famous for their strict laws, Singaporean PMs decided to incur a strategy based on psychology, where they hoped that unbanning porn would lead to an influx of people wanting to watch porn due to its former taboo status. It was a wild success, leading to almost the entire population becoming addicted to porn. However, with everyone staying at home and watching porn, certain sectors have started to fail, and protests have sprung up to bring back fast internet speeds so that citizens can continue watching porn.</p>
