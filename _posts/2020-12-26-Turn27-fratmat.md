**Yamoussoukro** -  At a press conference on Saturday, President Alassane Ouattara questioned the presence of Moroccan military forces in the disputed territory known as 'Western Sahara', or some call the Sahrawi Democratic People's Republic.

Citing the official African Union position on the subject, Ouattara reiterated that the Sahrawi people in the territory have a right to self-determination, and that the Moroccan presence in the territory interfered with their right to practice their form of self-government.

"Ignored by the rest of Africa for far too long, we must work together to ensure that the Sahrawi people can exercise their right to a form of government and self-determination."

When asked why Cote d'Ivoire has chosen this time to do so, Ouattara responded, "Until recently, Cote d'Ivoire has not been able to influence matters on the continent, unlike stronger powers such as Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, or South Africa, but with the recent economic developments in Abidjan, we have found ourselves on a similar level on political, economic, and military matters with the aforementioned countries. We thought that with Liberia having been caught attempting to infiltrate Morocco, it would be time to enforce the official AU position to try to maintain the integrity of the vision of the Union. Of course, this is a huge point of contention and I am still discussing this matter with representatives of other WAL nations to figure out the best course of action."

### **HIV-M**

Another topic on the president's mind was that of HIV-M, a recent mutation of HIV found to be resitant to current treatments. Ouattara sought to calm the public, citing that in a recent conversation with other WAL nations led by Mali, Cote d'Ivoire will be dedicating political resources to help fund the effort to search for a second treatment option. 

Ouattara noted that while he is happy to use the fruits of years past to lead the fight against the mutated virus, it frustrates him that the crisis could not come at a worse time for the nation, especially as Cote d'Ivoire is seeking to boost their political capabilities.

"It pains me that recent political projects designed to streamline the democratic process in Cote d'Ivoire and strengthen the power of the government must be diverted to combat a mutated virus we thought we had under control." said Ouattara.
