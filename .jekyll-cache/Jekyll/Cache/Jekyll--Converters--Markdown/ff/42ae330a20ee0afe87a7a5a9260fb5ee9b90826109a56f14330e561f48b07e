<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> - The University of Science and Technology-CÃ´te dâ€™Ivoireâ€™s Applied Technology Department has accepted a design challenge from Nexter Systems, an arms company based in France, to the Francophone world. If the UST-CI team wins, the university will recieve a 2,000,000 Ec grant and the Department of Applied Technology will continue to recieve 35% of the profits made from firearms sales for the next ten years. The gun will also be licensed to the Armed Forces of Cote dâ€™Ivoire.</p>

<p>Professor FrÃ©dÃ©ric Dohou, who is heading the project, reccently revealed in an interview that  he was looking to make an assault rifle that would be fit for use in a humid tropical climate, like Cote dâ€™Ivoire, and that initial designs were looking promising.</p>

<p>â€œIâ€™m looking to create a rifle that will have the durability and robustness of an AK-47, and is easy to take apart and clean. It will also use 7.62 x 39 mm rounds commonly used with AK-47â€™s and even more modern rifles like the AK-15. We are also developing a jungle submachine gun that will use 9mm rounds.â€</p>

<p>When asked why not just stick with the AK-47, Dohou responded â€œWhile nobody can top the AK-47, I donâ€™t think there would be any harm in at least trying a challenge to improve it. Kalashnikovâ€™s genius has remained unchallenged for more than 70 years and I think itâ€™d be fun to build upon his rifle.â€</p>

<p>The UST-CI faces significant competition from other engineering teams from countries such as Canada and Senegal. The contestants have approximately 6 months to submit their designs, where the contestants will travel to France to be judged.</p>
