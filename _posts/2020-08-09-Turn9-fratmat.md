**Abidjan** - The University of Science and Technology-Côte d'Ivoire's Applied Technology Department has accepted a design challenge from Nexter Systems, an arms company based in France, to the Francophone world. If the UST-CI team wins, the university will recieve a 2,000,000 Ec grant and the Department of Applied Technology will continue to recieve 35% of the profits made from firearms sales for the next ten years. The gun will also be licensed to the Armed Forces of Cote d'Ivoire. 

Professor Frédéric Dohou, who is heading the project, reccently revealed in an interview that  he was looking to make an assault rifle that would be fit for use in a humid tropical climate, like Cote d'Ivoire, and that initial designs were looking promising.

"I'm looking to create a rifle that will have the durability and robustness of an AK-47, and is easy to take apart and clean. It will also use 7.62 x 39 mm rounds commonly used with AK-47's and even more modern rifles like the AK-15. We are also developing a jungle submachine gun that will use 9mm rounds."

When asked why not just stick with the AK-47, Dohou responded "While nobody can top the AK-47, I don't think there would be any harm in at least trying a challenge to improve it. Kalashnikov's genius has remained unchallenged for more than 70 years and I think it'd be fun to build upon his rifle."

The UST-CI faces significant competition from other engineering teams from countries such as Canada and Senegal. The contestants have approximately 6 months to submit their designs, where the contestants will travel to France to be judged.
