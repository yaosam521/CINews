<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> -  Crowds last trimester were wowed when architecture students from Abidjan unveiled their new type of architectural designs: Ivorypunk. A brilliant form of Afrofuturism with a unique Ivorian flavor, these building designs were warmly received by architecture experts, engineers, and civilians who appreciated the new, futuristic look of the buildings. The National Assembly, who have long been looking to revitalize a part of the Plateau Commune where several companies vacated the area, seized the opportunity to approve building plans for new tech companies who have been looking to find space to plant regional branches of their headquarters, such as Ghanaian indie games publisher HiveBranch and Nigerian social media company BuzzGlow.</p>

<p>At the breaking ground ceremony, the Dean of Architecture at FHB University gave a speech to signify the designation of the Central Business Territory. With a local band playing “Old Days” by Chicago in the background, the Dean began his speech:</p>

<p>“The Central Business Territory (CBT) will be the new home of countless tech workers, who will enjoy working in our new Ivorypunk offices. We have already found new tenants, and floor 4 will be occupied by the data company Humblr. Visitng us today to help us break ground is Erika Nagai, who is representing a Pan-African/Asian Partnership company called Baul Strchr.”</p>

<p>Currently, the FHB University students are taking a break for their hard work, while some in Wakaliwood are finishing up creation of the set for a potential movie about Ivorypunk.</p>
