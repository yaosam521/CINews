<hr />

<p><strong>New York, New York</strong> - Matt Bellamy, the lead singer and lead guitar of the English Alternative Rock Band Muse, won twelve Grammy Awards this week for his wildly successful single, ‚ÄúMuscle Baby of Delusion‚Äù.</p>

<p>Bellamy had to accept the award from this year‚Äôs presenter, Ghanaian pop icon Mustafa Suleiman, with help from his bandmates Dom Howard and Chris Wolstenholme as Bellamy suffered some cognitive impairment from banging his head on a piano for 5 minutes straight during the recording of the song.</p>

<p>The single made the Afrobeats Top 20 singles chart and have continued to take the number one spot on the UK and US Singles charts ever since the release, despite heavy protests by practitioners of the targeted political ideology.</p>

<p>As soon as drummer Dom Howard teased the lyrics of the single on his Instagram, followers of Esoteric Anarcha-Thatcherism began flooding the comments with ad-hominems and death threats, with some threatening to ‚Äúhonk when Muse is dead‚Äù.</p>

<p>Nontheless, ‚ÄúMuscle Baby of Delusion‚Äù proves to be a popularity juggernaut, already receiving 50 million plays on Spotify and the music video receiving close to 1 billion views and a like to dislike ratio of 140,000 likes to 78 dislikes.</p>

<p>Doctors say that Bellamy should make a full recovery within a year.</p>
