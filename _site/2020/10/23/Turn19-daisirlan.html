<hr />

<p><strong>Addis Ababa</strong> - On Saturday, delegates from Cote d’Ivoire were admitted to Addis General Hospital after their shoulders finally gave in from carrying the initiative of many recent discussions on the Peace and Security Council. The subjects range from combatting Islamic extremism to the readmission of Ethiopia into the AU (which is strange considering they are the headquarters for the African Union).</p>

<p>At around 9:56 that morning, the Ivorian delegates were finished with their speech on the floor of the AU Headquarters when several began to complain about being very sore in the shoulders. Then, around 10:17, all but two of the delegates were writhing in pain on the floor, prompting several concerned representatives to place a call to the hospital. Many of the delegates complained that their hard work had paid off, but in the opposite way.</p>

<p>“The general inactivity of the other members of the PSC in starting discussions was concerning, so we decided to take initiative” said one of the delegates, who was in a full upper body cast and neck brace. “During the elections last year, we cast our votes to try and get the most active members on the PSC, but I think we made a mistake with the North African vote. We wanted to see what Egypt could bring to the table, but they have so far been absent, even during voting time, and regretfully they have taken the place of Libya, whose delegates have now been confined to the Assembly to make their voice heard.”</p>

<p>All of the delegates who were admitted into the hospital were upgraded from critical condition to stable condition at the time of this writing.</p>
