<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> -  As the WestAR is nearing completion, members of Le Daisirlan were invited to the WestAR development office in Abidjan to have a sneak peak at what entertainment will be available to those who have the money to pay for a luxury trip, and if youâ€™re a fan of <em>Thomas the Tank Engine</em> bootlegs with our presidentâ€™s face on the trains, youâ€™re in for a treat.</p>

<p>Since the financial planning for WestAR gave very little consideration for onboard entertainment for the passengers, the only movies available were <em>A Cure for Insomnia</em>, <em>Who Killed Captain Alex?</em>, <em>Chitty Chitty Bang Bang</em>, and <em>The Bye Bye Man</em>, as these were the only movies that were willing to be hosted on the trains as of this year. Riders can also view fine TV Shows such as <em>Joey</em>, the sequel to <em>Friends</em>, and they can also listen to Megalovania on repeat for the entire duration of the ride.</p>
