**Fire Base Abidjan** - Since the complete annihilation of the Ivorian Air Force in 2004 under then-President Laurent Gbagbo, the Air Force of the Ivory Coast had been neglected by the Ministry of Defense until this month, when it decided to spend money in a new state-of-the-art training program based in the PS2 game known as *Ace Combat 5*.

Long the subject of derision among the armed forces, particularly the Army and the Marines, Ivorian Air Force recruits will now be subjected to virtual training in *Ace Combat 5*, which was requested by the Air Force after their last training jet, a MiG-15 built in 1956, broke down in a training accident that left 437 injured. 

"It's funny to fly my planes directly into the ground so that everyone after me has to buy a new plane." said Airman Basic Jean LeClerc. "It's even funnier when they don't have the funds to buy a new plane and they get mad that they can't pass the training module."

As we were interviewing Airman Basic LeClerc, a fight broke out between Airmen over whose turn it was to play on the PlayStation/Training module. A Non-Commissioned Officer had to step in and break up the fist-fight as three hundred Arimen were sent back to their barracks as a timeout.

As of now, the Ivorian Air Force consists of a 1:1 Model of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang armed with sidewinder missiles, a P-51 Mustang, several Bell 206 
Helicopters, many with missing rotors, and an experimental flying car, rumored to have been stolen off the set of *Harry Potter*.
