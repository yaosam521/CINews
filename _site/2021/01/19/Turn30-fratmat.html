<hr />

<p><strong>Abidjan</strong> - In 2010, it was estimated that 80% of the Ivory Coast’s forests had disappeared due to relentless cocoa plantation expansion, and they will continue to do so until we figure out a way to cull the chocolate industry - and economists in Yamoussoukro have a plan to do so.</p>

<p>The group, nicknamed the “Cocoa Cavalry”, have submitted a plan to the Ministry of Economics to bring cocoa productions under the terms of those who produce them. The Cocoa Cavalry hopes that this will not only further increase the standards of living for cocoa farmers, but it could make a dent in the worrying trend towards climate change.</p>

<p>The plan involves working with all of the cocoa producing countries in the world to scale back production in order to halt deforestation and improper land use. This group, called the “International Cocoa United Producers”, will regulate the price of cocoa beans per tonne, similar to how OPEC determines and regulates the price of oil. They hope that this can stabilize the prices of cocoa beans so that the economies of cocoa producing countries can be improved and farmers can receive living wages and a higher quality of life.</p>

<p>But how else does Cocoa production ruin the world? What are some of the unforeseen consequences of rampant deforestation?</p>

<p>Deforestation results in lots of dead vegetation that releases a lot of unprocessed carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, making it one of the primary factors of climate change. In addition, there is less vegetation that can convert the carbon dioxide produced by animals and humans, further adding to the issue. If deforestation continues at the current rate, we could be seeing further desertification of the Sahel, leading to yet another refugee crisis.</p>

<p>With less rainforest habitat, wildlife will continue to clash with human development, and this is bad news for biodiversity. Not only could we see entire ecosystems collapse, but we could see the rise of new, deadly pandemics that we don’t have the cure for. Previously, viruses such as Ebola or the SARS-CoV2 virus (responsible for the COVID-19 Pandemic of the beginning of the decade) would not have found a host in humans had they remained isolated in their ecosystems, but with further interaction between dwindling wildlife, we could see an increase in animal viruses jumping to human hosts.</p>

<p>Deforestation might seem like a leviathan and a half to conquer, but with proper guidance and ambition, it can be reverse and our planet can stay healthy for future generations.</p>
