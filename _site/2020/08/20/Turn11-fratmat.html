<hr />

<p><strong>Yamoussoukro</strong> - President Ouattara has issued an apology for brokering an arms deal with the United States after recent events shed light that extremist groups in America were funneling weapons to Anti-Muslim terror groups in the Central African Republic.</p>

<p>During Friday’s press conference, Ouattara said he deeply regretted asking the United States for military weapons around the same time that Christian extremist groups in the US donated weapons to anti-muslim terror groups operating in the Central African Republic. He reiterated that it is morally reprehensible to buy weapons from the same country that is donating the very same equipment to murder civilians, and that should Cote d’Ivoire find itself in need of military equipment, it should look to Europe or ask neighboring countries such as Ghana or Nigeria.</p>

<p>“I truly regret that we have decided to buy the same weapons that were sent by extremists in the United States specifically to aid so-called Christian groups in the Central African Republic to target those they deem unworthy of life”, said Ouattara. “As such, I am encouraging soldiers in the armed forces who are using American equipment to switch over to our old Soviet-era AK-47’s, or the firearms that our brothers in Europe have generously loaned us.”</p>

<p>The press conference promptly turned to a more hopeful note as he announced that the plans to create the infrastructure for a nationwide chocolate industry is nearing completion and should be done within the next three trimesters.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, soldiers in Bouaké have heeded Ouattara’s words at the press conference and many soldiers lined up at the armory Saturday morning looking to trade their newly acquired M4 assault rifles for French or Soviet-era weapons.</p>

<p>“I just like the look of the AK-47, ya know?” said Pvt. Jean Coulibaly. “It’s a classic rifle, it can withstand pretty much any weather or terrain thrown at it, and it’s just overall a great weapon. Also, I think that it’s inexcuseable to be holding a weapon that’s going to remind civilians of those extremist guys in the CAR. I heard we may be doing support operations elsewhere in Africa soon.”</p>

<p>Like many soldiers, Pvt. Coulibaly had felt that using the M4 would be a sign of bending the knee to American militarism, similar in the way that the AK-47 is a symbol of Soviet engineering and ingenuity. Many soldiers were reported to have carved phrases such as “Baby killer” and “This Machine Murders Civilians” after news broke out that American NGO’s were donating weapons to rebels in CAR.</p>
